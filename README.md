# Heart-Disease-Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Heart Disease or not using machine learning. The project is based on the Heart Disease Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. I am submitting this as my Internship task at TechnoHacks EduTech.
# Objective
The objective of this task is to check whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart diseases based on their medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc.
# Content
Attribute Information:<br>

1. age<br>
2. sex<br>
3. chest pain<br> 
4. resting blood pressure<br>
5. serum cholestoral<br>
6. fasting blood sugar<br>
7. resting electrocardiographic<br>
8. maximum heart rate achieved<br>
9. exercise induced angina<br>
10. oldpeak<br>
11. slope<br>
12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy<br>
13. thal
# Algortihms Used
1. Logistic Regression<br>
2. Support Vector Machine<br>
3. KNN<br>
4. Random Forest Classifier<br>
5. Decision Tree Classifier
# Packages and Tools Required
1. Pandas<br>
2. Matplotlib<br>
3. Seaborn<br>
4. Numpy<br>
5. Scikit Learn<br>
6. Jupyter Notebook
# Conclusion
After performing 5 different algorithms on the dataset, Decision Tree gave the best performance with 98% accuracy. So I decide to consider it for further evaluation.
