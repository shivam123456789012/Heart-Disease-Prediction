# Heart-Disease-Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Heart Disease or not using machine learning. The project is based on the Heart Disease Prediction dataset obtained from Kaggle. I am submitting this as my Internship task at TechnoHacks EduTech.
# Objective
The objective of this task is to check whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart diseases based on their medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level, etc.
